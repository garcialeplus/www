      <h1>Working with Illustrator</h1>
      <p>Illustrator was the second application used in the class. We
      learned to use vectors. The final work was to make our logo. I
      decided to make the logo with my initials to use as an image on
      my photography page. I really liked being able to combine the
      image of my initials on top of one of my photos and use text in
      the same project. Illustrator blows my mind and I imagine
      endless things that I can create. I can see myself participating
      in projects where I can design the image of a company or
      person. Personally, I used this application to design the
      invitations for my wedding and I loved it.</p>
